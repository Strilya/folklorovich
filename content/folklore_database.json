Sailors would cancel voyages if a black cat boarded their ship. Better to wait than tempt fate. The ritual seems simple, but those who ignore it remember their mistake when the day turns dark.",

Say your child is healthy, knock wood. Mention your business succeeds, knock wood. Boast about anything, and the ritual must follow or fate will punish your pride. Russians knock constantly during conversation, a rhythm of protection woven into daily speech. The gesture connects to ancient tree worship, when spirits lived in oak and birch, and wood was the bridge between human and divine.",

The darkness transforms ordinary waste into a channel for loss. Wait for daylight when protective forces are strong. The domovoi sleeps at night and cannot guard what you throw away.
