He became the greatest of all bogatyrs, defending Kiev from enemies and monsters. He defeated Nightingale the Robber, whose whistle killed men. He fought alongside Dobrynya and Alyosha, the three heroes standing between Russia and destruction. When he died, he was buried as a monk, and centuries later his mummified body was discovered in the Kiev Caves—real bones of a legendary man.",

In truth, he was both—proof that brains matter as much as muscle when defending your homeland from the darkness beyond the borders.",
